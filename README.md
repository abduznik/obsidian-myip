## For Developers

This plugin is built with TypeScript.

- `main.ts`: The main entry point of the plugin.
- `manifest.json`: The plugin manifest.

### Build

To build the plugin, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the plugin.

This will create a `main.js` file in the project root, which you can then use to test the plugin in Obsidian.
